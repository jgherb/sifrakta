# sifrakta
SiFrakta is a mathematical software which is able to create various fractals. 

Initially it was written in C#.
Those builds are for Windows Desktop (.NET-Framework required) and Windows RT.

Since October 2015 the project was restarted in C++.
Those builds are tested for Windows Desktop (compiled with MinGW) and Linux (compiled with gcc).
They may work on other OS, but they weren't compiled and tested yet.
C++ enables a better performance and one code for different OS.

SiFrakta is a project from Julius Herb.
